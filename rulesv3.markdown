### Examples

20 Clanrats: 20 Militia (8) + 20 Spears (8) + 20 Shields (8) = 24 Points
20 Vulkites: 20 Soldiers (28) + 20 Axes (28) + 20 Shields (8) = 64 Points
10 Hearthguard: 10 Elite (35) + 10 Axes (15) + 10 Shields (5) = 55 Points

## Rules

A round consists of a number of activations per player.
The first player is determined randomly by rolloff.

The number of activations is determined by game size:
- Encounter (50 points): 2 activations per player
- Skirmish (100 points): 3 activations per player
- Assault (200 points): 4 activations per player
- Clash (400 points): 5 activations per player
- Battle (800 points): 6 activations per player
- War (1600 points): 7 activations per player

If using an intermediate value, it's considered the previous size. The minimum possible is 50 points.

A unit may normally be activated once.
It may be activated a second time if *pushed*.
If a player is unable (or unwilling) to use his remaining activations, he may discard them.
His opponent may then continue to use activations normally, but the players will no longer alternate for the round.

### Activations

When a player activates a unit, they may choose any of the following orders:
- Shoot: the unit attacks with its ranged weapons, remaining stationary.
- Advance: the unit moves up to its movement in any direction. It must remain in cohesion and cannot end in contact with an enemy.
- Charge: the unit moves up to its movement + 2d6 in any direction. It must remain in cohesion and must end in contact with an enemy.
- Hold: the unit does not move, but gets a +1 defensive bonus.

### Attacks

Each miniature has one
