## Turn structure

A *Turn* has 2 *Phases*:

1. Action: players take turns in activating units that haven't been activated this turn.
2. Leadership: players count casualties and use special skills.

The first player to act in the Action phase is determined by a roll-off.

## Units and Models

A unit is a group of models.
Whenever you need to find the value of any model's characteristic, if it doesn't have one, please use it's unit's characteristic instead.
All models in a unit must be within 1" of each other at all times.

## Attacks and damage

When a unit attacks another unit first select which models within range of the unit will attack it.

First, roll a die for each model attacking the unit and compare it to its *Precision*: if the roll is equal or lower, it scores a **HIT**.
Then, for each **HIT**, roll dice equal to the model's *Damage* and compare it to the target unit's *Armor* minus the attacker's *Pierce*: if the roll is higher, it scores a **WOUND**.
Keep track of the number of **WOUNDS** suffered by each unit throughout the turn.

A unit may declare multiple units as its target.
If it does, declare which models within range attack which unit and then resolve the attacks separately.

# The Turn

## Action Phase

Players take turns activating units that haven't yet activated.

They may take the following Actions:

- Move: A unit must not be in combat to Move. To Move a unit, move each of the models a distance up to the model's Move characteristic. 
- Run: A unit must not be in combat to Run. To Run a unit, take the Move action adding +4".
- Charge: A unit must not be in combat to Charge. To Charge a unit, it must move into combat. This move may be of up to its Move characteristic +4". It may then immediately Fight.
- Shoot: Attack with their Ranged Weapons. If the unit is in combat it must Attack a unit it's in combat with. If it isn't, it may Move before or after Shooting.
- Retreat: A unit must be in combat to Retreat. A unit may not Retreat if it was Charged this turn. To Retreat a unit, take the Move action twice. It must end outside of combat.
- Fight: A unit must be in combat to Fight. Attack with that unit's Melee Weapons. You may make an Adjust move of up to 3" with that unit before attacking. This move cannot take you out of combat.

## Leadership

The Leadership Phase consists of a series of steps:

1. Leadership Skills
2. Resolve Wounds
3. Test Morale

### Leadership Skills

Thess will be shown in the unit's rules.

### Resolve Wounds

Each player clears the wounds from a unit by damaging models.
Once a player has started damaging a model they must continue to do so until that model is slain.
A model is slain when it suffers damage equal to its Health characteristic.
A slain model is removed from the game.

### Test Morale

Every unit that had  models slain must make a Morale test.
To do so, roll a die for the unit and add the amount of models slain in the unit this turn.

If the amount exceeds its Bravery, a number of models equal to the difference flee from the battle and are removed from the game.
